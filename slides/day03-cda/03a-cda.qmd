## Quarto
Hi Quarto!
Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto presentations see <https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/>.

## Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

## Code

When you click the **Render** button a presentation will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

## Some code

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(magrittr)
lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

## Code Annotation

```{r}
#| echo: true
library(beepr)
beep() # <1>
# a comment # <2>
```

1. Here we can exlain what that line of code is doing.
2. Here we can explain that the second line is just a comment.

## Math

$$x+7\beta$$

Even more math:

$x+7 +\mu$

## Figure

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| out.width: '40%'
#| fig.align: 'center'
knitr::include_graphics('img/socalds-logo.png')
```
